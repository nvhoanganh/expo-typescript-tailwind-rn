## Running the App

Start the local server. This will give you a QR code that you can scan using the Expo Client app on your mobile device.

```shell
yarn start
```

If you're on a Mac and have Xcode installed, you can run the app using the iOS Simulator with the following command. I am sure you can do something similar with Android.

```shell
yarn ios
```
